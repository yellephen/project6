# project6

Cross platform with a GUI and few dependencies. You are dreaming! So linux only. Linux GUI is bananas to me. Best dev may C++ an elf with the right libraries.<br><br>
Python GUI? There are many python libraries available on pip that do gui. I am getting excited. I should learn about Exegol while I'm there. Python is bad for the environment. A text editor with a scripting language is hilarious. 

--------------------------------------------
It should be a linux executable.
That is a text editor
With a file tree
File > New - I am not a dev.
I'm sick of restricted environments.
Rearrange two windows, thunar or whatever it's called on tuesdays on the left and great editor on the right.

---------------------------------------------
It'll be great but basic. The sparse features I'm looking for are

	- Is a text editor
	- With an editable file tree on the left
	- As few dependencies as possible

	- Alternatively, learn vi? 
	- Make a vi clone with a file tree on the left
	- Then learn vi lol
	- More like nano with a file tree on the left
	- Add vi features if I got there and realised they're good
	- Does the editor need mouse support? It needs to support end and home keys. Mouse support is great for a glitching system.
	- Notepad with an editable filetree on the left
	- Write it in .net and cross compile it
For as few dependencies as possible, make it an exe/elf and thatâ€™s it.
